## Features

<!-- TODO README
- user instruction how to search
- backend instructions

 -->

Search block with highly overridable components for searching, filtering and displaying search results. Sometimes also called faceted navigation.

As this search is addressing `OpenSearch/ElasticSearch` with text analysis, the search does understand inflection of words, tolerates typos by fuzzy searching, allows exact search and wildcard search.
See [User documentation](#user-documentation) on how to search.

Matched phrases are shown with highlighted matches.

Additional metadata per result item can be configured easily.
Meta data values are clickable to find related content.

The block is prepared for Matomo analytics.

## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon volto-searchkit-block
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `volto-searchkit-block` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "volto-searchkit-block"
],

"dependencies": {
    "volto-searchkit-block": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Volto 18 and later

Add `volto-searchkit-block` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "volto-searchkit-block": "*"
}
```

Add `volto-searchkit-block` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['volto-searchkit-block'];
```

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).


### Pre-requisites

-   [Node.js](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#node-js)
-   [Make](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#make)
-   [Docker](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#docker)
