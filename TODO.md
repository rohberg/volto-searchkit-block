- Restrict block creation to Site Admins.
  In future, blocks creation can be restricted by permission / role. Then change attribute "restricted" to false. Until then: download add-on, change restricted to false, add block, switch back to restricted true.
  `config.blocks.blocksConfig.searchkitblock.restricted`
