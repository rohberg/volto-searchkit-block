## Features

<!-- TODO README
- user instruction how to search
- backend instructions
- ‚Ä¶
 -->

Search block with highly overridable components for searching, filtering and displaying search results. Sometimes also called faceted navigation.

As this search is addressing `OpenSearch/ElasticSearch` with text analysis, the search does understand inflection of words, tolerates typos by fuzzy searching, allows exact search and wildcard search.
See [User documentation](#user-documentation) on how to search.

Matched phrases are shown with highlighted matches.

Additional metadata per result item can be configured easily.
Meta data values are clickable to find related content.

The block is prepared for Matomo analytics.

## Installation

### Plone backend

TODO backend instructions

### OpenSearch / ElasticSearch 

TODO OpenSearch

### Volto frontend

Add `volto-searchkit-block` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@rohberg/volto-searchkit-block": "^2.0.0"
}
```

Add `@rohberg/volto-searchkit-block` to your add-ons in `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['@rohberg/volto-searchkit-block'];
```

### Configuration of the search block

## User instructions

The search is a fuzzy search, that means typos are compensated.
Approximate matches and inflections are found.

To force the match of a search string, precede it with "+".
To exclude matches of a search string, precede it with "-".

Use wildcards to find matches of words that complement the search string.

For exact matches of a search string embrace it with quotation marks.

A search for a word with hyphen is equivalent to a search for the word and the parts of it.  
Example: A search for "LSR-Lehrbetrieb" is equivalent to a search for "LSR-Lehrbetrieb LSR Lehrbetrieb"

Words with hyphen are matched by searches for part of the words.  
Example: "LSR-Lehrbetrieb" is found by a search for "LSR".

### Multiple search strings

Search results include at least one of the search strings.


# Panel for testing matches

You can test search results on a test panel: `/controlpanel/test-searchkit-querystrings`

Please update the settings according to your deployment: `/controlpanel/volto_searchkit_block_control_panel`

## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18.

```

### Development environment set up

It's recommended to start three individual terminal sessions, one each for running the Plone backend, the Volto frontend, and the index server.
All sessions should start from the root directory.

Install backend.

```shell
make dev-backend-install
```

Install the frontend.

```shell
make install
```

### Start developing

Start the backend. Monolingual:

```shell
make dev-backend-start-monolingual
```

or start the multilingual backend:

```shell
make dev-backend-start-monolingual
```

Create a site.

```shell
make create-site-monolingual
```

or create a multilingual site:

```shell
make create-site-multilingual
```

Start the index server. Monolingual:

```shell
make dev-index-start-monolingual 
```
or start the index server multilingual:

```shell
make dev-index-start-multilingual 
```

In a separate terminal session, start the frontend.

```shell
make start-monolingual
```

or start multilingual:

```shell
make start-multilingual
```

### Lint code

Run ESlint, Prettier, and Stylelint in analyze mode.

```shell
make lint
```

### Format code

Run ESlint, Prettier, and Stylelint in fix mode.

```shell
make format
```

### i18n

Extract the i18n messages to locales.

```shell
make i18n
```

### Unit tests

Run unit tests.

```shell
make test
```

### Run Cypress tests

Run each of these steps in separate terminal sessions.

In the first session, start the frontend in development mode.

```shell
make acceptance-frontend-dev-start-monolingual
```

In the second session, start the backend acceptance server.

```shell
make acceptance-backend-start-monolingual
```

In the third session, start the Cypress interactive test runner.

```shell
make acceptance-test-monolingual
```

Appropriate make commands for **multilingual** Cypress tests are available.
